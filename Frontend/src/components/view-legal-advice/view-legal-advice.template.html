		<p><b>Definition of sponsoring:</b> is the granting of financial resources in order to promote persons, groups of people
			or organizations in sports, culture, science and many more. The main target can be either to facilitate the sponsored
			partner to further accomplish their goals, or to follow personal/organizational interests.</p>

		<p><b>Legal base:</b> The legal base for sponsoring is different in each country. In Germany, the "Schreiben des Bundesministerium f√ºr Finanzen (BMF)" is defining
		the handling of sponsorship deals</p>
		<b>Tax regulations for sponsorship income</b>
		<p>In Germany, sponsorship income can be assigned two three different areas  :<br>
		<li>the case where sponsorship income is seen as a donation (this is seldom the case).</li>
		<li>the case of tax free fund management. This is a special case in which advertisment rights are sold.</li>
		<li>and the basic taxable case (based on the service for service principle).</li></ul></p><br>
